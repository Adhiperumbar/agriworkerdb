# AgriWorker Management System

## Overview
The **AgriWorker Management System** is a web-based application designed to efficiently manage agricultural workers, their skills, job positions, and training sessions. It streamlines workforce allocation by automatically assigning experienced workers to suitable job positions based on their skill sets and experience. This system is particularly useful for agricultural organizations to optimize labor management, track training, and improve productivity.

## Project Motivation
Agricultural labor management is often manual and inefficient, leading to mismatches between workersâ€™ skills and job requirements.  
This project aims to:
- Automate worker-job matching based on skills and experience.  
- Simplify tracking of workers and training sessions.  
- Provide a structured and easy-to-manage database for agricultural workforce management.

## How Automatic Assignment Works

1. Calculate worker experience from `datehired`.
2. Identify workers with experience > 5 years.
3. Compare worker skillset with required skills for all job positions.
4. Assign worker automatically to all matching job positions.
5. Prevent duplicate assignments.
